\begin{abstract}
    Storm surges in Singapore have already been investigated and covered in existing literature. Howvever, a differentiation must be made
    between storm surges and monsoon surge events. This research/paper/submission aims to find a correlation between observed sea level anomalies, wind speed anomalies
    and if they can probabilistically predicted from pre-existing data, and the chances of them occurring during specific time periods. It has been known that strong winds, and high tides are associated with monsoon surge events, but so far there has been no particular characterization of what sort of tides can allows us to predict/give us information about monsoon surge events in Singapore.

        \noindent With sea levels projected to rise as a result of climate change, it is imperative to understand
not only long-term average trends, but also the spatial and temporal patterns of extreme sea
level. In this study, we use a comprehensive set of 30 tide gauges spanning 1954–2014 to
characterize the spatial and temporal variations of extreme sea level around the low-lying and densely populated margins of the South China Sea. We also explore the long-term evo-
lution of extreme sea level by applying a dynamic linear model for the generalized extreme value distribution (DLM-GEV), which can be used for assessing the changes in extreme
sea levels with time. Our results show that the sea-level maxima distributions range from
~90 to 400 cm and occur seasonally across the South China Sea. In general, the sea-level
maxima at northern tide gauges are approximately $25-30\%$ higher than those in the south and are highest in summer as tropical cyclone-induced surges dominate the northern sig-
nal. In contrast, the smaller signal in the south is dominated by monsoonal winds in the winter. The trends of extreme high percentiles of sea-level values are broadly consistent
with the changes in mean sea level. The DLM-GEV model characterizes the interannual variability of extreme sea level, and hence, the 50-year return levels at most tide gauges.
We find small but statistically signifcant correlations between extreme sea level and both
the Pacifc Decadal Oscillation and El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Our study provides new
insight into the dynamic relationships between extreme sea level, mean sea level and the
tidal cycle in the South China Sea, which can contribute to preparing for coastal risks at
multi-decadal timescales.

        \noindent Among the semi-enclosed basins of the world ocean, the South China Sea (SCS) is unique in its configuration
        as it lies under the main southwest-northeast pathway of the seasonal monsoons. The northeast (NE) monsoon
        (November-February) and southwest monsoon (June-August) dominate the large scale sea level dynamics of
        the SCS. Sunda Shelf at the southwest part of SCS tends to amplify Sea Level Anomalies (SLAs) generated
        by winds over the sea. The entire region, bounded by Gulf of Thailand on the north, Karimata Strait on the
        south, east cost of Peninsular Malaysia on the west, and break of Sunda Shelf on the east, could experience
        positive or negative SLAs depending on the wind direction and speed. Strong sea level surges during NE
        monsoon, if coincide with spring tide, usually lead to coastal floods in the region. To understand the
        phenomena, we analyzed the wind-driven sea level anomalies focusing on Singapore Strait (SS), laying at the
        most southwest point of the region. An analysis of Tanjong Pagar (TG) tide gauge data in the SS, as well as
        satellite altimetry and reanalyzed wind in the region, reveal that the wind over central part of SCS is arguably
        the most important factor determining the observed variability of SLAs at hourly to monthly scales.
        Climatological SLAs in SS are found to be positive, and of the order of 30 cm during NE monsoon, but
        negative, and of the order of 20 cm during SW monsoon. The largest anomalies are associated with
        intensified winds during NE monsoon, with historical highs exceeding 50 cm. At the hourly and daily timescales, SLA magnitude is correlated with the NE wind speed over central part of SCS with an average time lag
        of 36 to 42 hours. An exact solution is derived by approximating the elongated SCS shape with onedimensional two-step channel. The solution is utilized to fit empirical function connecting SLAs in SS with
        the wind speeds over central part of SCS. Due to delay of sea level anomaly in SS with respect to the remote
        source at SCS, the simplified solutions could be used for storm surge forecast, with a lead time exceeding one
        day.
