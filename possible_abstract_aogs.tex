\begin{abstract}
    Storm surges in Singapore have already been investigated and covered in existing literature. Howvever, a differentiation must be made
    between storm surges and monsoon surge events. This research/paper/submission aims to find a correlation between observed sea level anomalies, wind speed anomalies
    and if they can probabilistically predicted from pre-existing data, and the chances of them occurring during specific time periods. It has been known that strong winds, and high tides are associated with monsoon surge events, but so far there has been no particular characterization of what sort of tides can allows us to predict/give us information about monsoon surge events in Singapore.
