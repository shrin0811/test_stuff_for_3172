\begin{abstract}
    Storm surges in Singapore have already been investigated and covered in existing literature. Howvever, a differentiation must be made
    between storm surges and monsoon surge events. This research/paper/submission aims to find a correlation between observed sea level anomalies, wind speed anomalies
    and if they can probabilistically predicted from pre-existing data, and the chances of them occurring during specific time periods.
